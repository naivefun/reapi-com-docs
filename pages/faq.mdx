# ReAPI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Is ReAPI Free?

**ReAPI operates on a freemium model.** This means that we offer a basic version of our software for free, which includes a range of essential features. We are currently in the process of designing our paid plans, which will offer additional advanced features and capabilities. These paid plans are expected to be released later this year.

### 2. Is ReAPI Open Source?

**Future Plans for Open Source:** While ReAPI is not entirely open source at the moment, we have plans to open source several useful components and engines in the future. Our current focus is on stabilizing our features and expanding our capabilities, given our limited resources. We are committed to contributing to the open-source community as we grow.

### 3. Does ReAPI Provide APIs for Developers?

**API Availability:** Yes, we are planning to release APIs for developers later this year. These APIs will allow developers to integrate and interact with ReAPI's features more seamlessly in their own applications and workflows.
