# Get Started with Custom Scripts

Before diving into custom scripts, **make sure you have read the [overview section](../scripts/overview)** to understand the context and benefits of using custom scripts in ReAPI.

## Considerations and Strict Rules for Writing Scripts in ReAPI

Scripts in ReAPI are designed with specific considerations and strict rules to ensure they are effective, maintainable, and provide the best possible editing experience.

**Considerations:**

1. **Favoring Async/Await Over Callbacks**: To simplify asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell, ReAPI encourages the use of `async/await` syntax.
2. **Optimized Editing Experience**: The structure and rules for scripts are designed to provide optimal support for auto-complete, error-checking, and other IDE-like features in the web editor.

**Rules:**

1. **Each Script Must Be an Async Function**:

   - **Requirement**: Every custom script must be an `async` function.
   - **Structure**: The script must strictly start with `async function funcName() {` and end with `}`. No code or comments are allowed outside of this function structure.
   - **Function Name**: Only `runScript`, `beforeRequest`, and `afterResponse` are allowed as function names.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     async function beforeRequest() {
       // Your code here
     }
     ```

2. **Always Use Await and Promise-Based APIs**:

   - **Requirement**: Use `await` with promise-based APIs for all asynchronous operations.
   - **Handling Callbacks**: If you need to use a callback-based API, wrap it in a promise. You can use libraries like `pify` to easily convert callback-based functions into promise-based ones.
   - **Example**:

     ```javascript
     async function runScript() {
       const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
       const data = response.json();
       // Process data
     }
     ```

3. **Modify Data with JSON-Compatible Types Only**:
   - **Requirement**: When modifying or assigning data within your script, ensure that only JSON-compatible data types are used. Complex data types that cannot be serialized (e.g., functions, DOM elements) are not allowed.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     async function afterResponse() {
       const user = {
         name: "John Doe",
         age: 30,
         // Only JSON-compatible data types
       };
       $context.userData = user; // Valid assignment
     }
     ```

Following these rules ensures that your custom scripts are efficient, maintainable, and compatible with ReAPIâ€™s environment, providing a smooth experience in both scripting and test execution.
