# SOAP/XML API Testing with ReAPI: Simplify Complex APIs

SOAP-based APIs may not be as widespread as they once were, but they still play a crucial role in many systems. However, testing SOAP APIs can be challenging due to their complexity—SOAP relies heavily on strict XML formatting, WSDL definitions, and often complex message structures.

With ReAPI, you get a first-class SOAP testing experience, designed to make your work faster and easier:

1. **Activate SOAP/XML Support**  
   When creating an API test step, simply go to the **Request Options** tab and enable the 'SOAP/XML' option. This activates all the necessary SOAP features for smooth testing.

2. **WSDL Integration**  
   ReAPI provides a **WSDL button** that allows you to import operations from WSDL with just a few clicks. Select the service, port, and operation, and ReAPI will automatically populate the HTTP method, URL, headers, and SOAP body (if available). This saves time and avoids manual errors.

3. **Smart XML Editing**  
   ReAPI’s XML editor streamlines the creation of complex XML by auto-closing tags, making it faster to type long tag names. This ensures that your SOAP request format is valid while improving efficiency.

4. **Seamless XML to JSON Conversion**  
   One of the standout features is ReAPI’s ability to automatically convert XML responses into JSON format. The response becomes easily accessible via `response.json`, and with ReAPI's auto-completion, you can quickly select nested properties for assertions, making SOAP response validation effortless.

By offering advanced SOAP support, ReAPI simplifies the process of testing even the most complex SOAP APIs, enabling you to focus on ensuring API quality with minimal hassle.
