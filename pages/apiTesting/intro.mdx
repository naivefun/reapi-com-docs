# Introduction to ReAPI API Testing

## Overview

ReAPI API Testing is a robust, no-code platform designed to streamline the process of testing APIs. Whether you're a developer or a QA engineer with little to no coding experience, ReAPI enables you to create, manage, and automate API tests with ease. The platform supports collaboration across teams, offering features that enhance productivity and ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

## Core Features and Benefits

### No-Code Testing Platform

ReAPI stands out with its no-code testing capabilities, allowing users to create and run tests without writing any code. This feature democratizes testing, enabling both technical and non-technical team members to contribute to the testing process. The intuitive interface makes it easy to build complex test scenarios using drag-and-drop functionality and predefined test steps.

### In-Browser Editing and Debugging

One of the most convenient features of ReAPI is the ability to edit and debug test cases directly in the browser. With the support of a Chrome extension, users can:
- **Edit Test Cases**: Modify and enhance test cases with a user-friendly interface.
- **Debug Tests**: Debug test runs in real-time, viewing detailed logs and outputs.
- **Cloud Sync**: Upload the state of each test run to the cloud and share it with relevant team members, ensuring everyone stays in sync.

### Serverless Test Execution and Scheduling

ReAPI eliminates the need for setting up and maintaining your own server for test execution. Users can:
- **Run Tests Anywhere**: Execute tests on ReAPI’s cloud infrastructure or on your own server.
- **Scheduling**: Schedule tests to run at specific intervals using rate-based or cron-based scheduling, ensuring tests are executed regularly and automatically.

### Intelligent Editor

The intelligent editor in ReAPI supports:
- **Auto-Completion**: Track and auto-complete data properties and context properties while writing assertions and context operations, reducing errors and speeding up the test creation process.
- **Context Awareness**: The editor understands the context of the data and provides relevant suggestions, making it easier to write precise and accurate tests.

### Sophisticated Test Steps

ReAPI supports a wide range of test steps to create comprehensive and versatile test scenarios:
- **API Calls**: Define and execute API requests.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement if-else statements to handle different response scenarios.
- **Iteration**: Loop through data sets to test multiple conditions and inputs.
- **References**: Reuse existing test cases by referring to them within new tests, promoting efficiency and consistency.
- **Selectors**: Select scoped test cases for specific test plans, such as testing only critical cases within a certain folder.

### Integrated API Documentation

ReAPI seamlessly integrates with API documentation, offering:
- **Auto-Generation of Requests**: Automatically generate request parameters and body based on the provided API documentation.
- **Schema Validation**: Validate responses against the API documentation’s schema, ensuring that your API behaves as expected and adheres to its specifications.

### Test Management with Tags and Folders

Organizing and managing test cases is simplified with the ability to use tags and folders:
- **Tags and Folders**: Categorize test cases by tags and folders for better organization and easy retrieval.
- **Test Runners**: Create test runners by selecting specific tags and folders, allowing you to run a subset of tests focused on particular areas or functionalities.
- **Test Deployment**: Bind test runners with specific environments for automated testing on the cloud or your own server. This feature enables targeted and efficient test automation, ensuring that tests are executed in the appropriate context.

## Workflow

ReAPI’s workflow is designed to be straightforward and efficient, guiding users from test case creation to automated deployment.

### Step 1: Write Test Cases

Begin by writing your test cases using the no-code editor. Utilize the platform’s intelligent features like auto-completion and context-aware suggestions to ensure accuracy and efficiency. You can include a variety of test steps such as API calls, conditional logic, iterations, and references to other test cases.

### Step 2: Create Test Runner

Once your test cases are ready, create a test runner by selecting scoped test cases using tags and folders. This allows you to organize and focus your testing efforts on specific areas or functionalities, such as only running critical tests under the 'users' folder.

### Step 3: Deploy Test Runner

Finally, deploy your test runner by binding it with a specific environment. This can be done on ReAPI’s cloud infrastructure or your own server. Deploying the test runner automates the execution of your tests, allowing you to schedule them using rate-based or cron-based scheduling.
