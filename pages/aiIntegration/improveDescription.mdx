# Improve Description with AI in ReAPI

ReAPI harnesses the power of AI to elevate the quality of schema documentation, making it an invaluable tool for developers looking to enhance their API descriptions. This feature is particularly beneficial for refining property descriptions, offering suggestions for improvement, and even providing translation capabilities.

### AI-Enhanced Description Generation

The AI's content production capability in ReAPI's schema editor extends to generating descriptions for individual properties. This feature is a boon for developers who may struggle with articulating the precise function or purpose of a schema property.

### Refinement and Suggestion

- **Improvement Suggestions**: If you're uncertain about the quality of your writing, the AI can suggest amended versions of your descriptions. This ensures that your API documentation is not only accurate but also clearly articulated.
- **Enhancing Clarity**: The AI's suggestions can help clarify complex technical details, making your API more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

### Translation for Non-Native Speakers

- **Automatic Translation**: For non-native English speakers, the AI can translate descriptions from your native language into the target language. This feature is particularly useful in global teams where developers might be more comfortable writing in their first language.
- **Service Settings Configuration**: Simply configure your target language in the service settings, and the AI will automatically produce the translated descriptions.

### Streamlining API Documentation

The integration of AI in ReAPI's schema editor for description generation and improvement significantly streamlines the process of creating API documentation. It not only saves time but also enhances the quality and accessibility of the documentation.
