# Generate OpenAPI Specification with AI

ReAPI offers a streamlined and efficient way to generate an OpenAPI specification from scratch, making it an ideal tool for developers who are in the early stages of API design and want to quickly turn their ideas into a tangible blueprint.

### Rapid Specification Creation

With ReAPI, you can jumpstart your API development process. Begin by simply providing your API service name and a brief description. Then, outline your API's features in a nested format, where the indentation signifies the parent-child relationship between different components of your API.

### AI-Powered Spec Generation

Leveraging AI, ReAPI intelligently interprets this nested structure and automatically generates a comprehensive OpenAPI specification. This AI-driven process typically includes a well-organized structure with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your listed features, neatly arranged in folders for clarity and ease of navigation.

### Incremental Feature Addition

Due to the limitations of the OpenAI API, **it's recommended to create three or fewer features at a time**. This approach ensures that the response is complete and usable. To expand your API, utilize the merge service feature. This allows you to add extra features incrementally without affecting the existing content, ensuring a seamless development process.

### Starting Point for Further Refinement

While ReAPI's AI generates a solid foundation for your OpenAPI spec, the initial schema details may be basic. This serves as a starting point, and you'll need to refine and expand upon these details to fully tailor the specification to your project's requirements. The generated spec provides a significant head start, allowing you to focus on enhancing and customizing the schema to meet your specific needs.
