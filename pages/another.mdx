# The Predominant Code-First Approach in Current API Platforms

In the landscape of current API platforms, there's a noticeable trend towards a 'Code-First' approach. This methodology prioritizes the debugging of APIs before the creation of comprehensive documentation. While this approach has its merits in certain scenarios, it often leads to a significant drawback:

<div class="border rounded-lg divide-y mt-6">
  <div class="p-4 flex justify-center">
    <Wait4Backend />
  </div>
  <div class="p-4 flex justify-center">
    <DesignFirst />
  </div>
</div>

### Documentation as an Afterthought

- **Subpar Documentation Quality:** Documentation derived from debug data in a Code-First approach often lacks the depth and clarity required for good documentation. It tends to be more of a byproduct of the debugging process rather than a well-thought-out guide.

### The Impact of Code-First on API Quality

- **Limited Scope:** Code-First often results in documentation that only covers aspects of the API that have been tested, leaving out potentially crucial information.
- **Inconsistency:** Since the focus is on debugging rather than documenting, the resulting documentation can be inconsistent and fragmented.
- **Delayed Knowledge Sharing:** Documentation created post-debugging delays the sharing of API knowledge, impacting team collaboration and efficiency.

## ReAPI's Design-First Alternative

- **Holistic Documentation:** ReAPIâ€™s design-first approach ensures that documentation is comprehensive and created with intention, covering all aspects of the API.
- **Consistent and Collaborative:** By prioritizing documentation, ReAPI fosters consistency and facilitates better collaboration among team members from the start.
- **Balanced Approach:** While emphasizing documentation, ReAPI also integrates sophisticated debugging tools, offering a balanced and efficient workflow.

### Bridging the Gap for Code-First Teams

- **Convenient Tools for Documentation:** Understanding the prevalence of the Code-First approach, ReAPI provides convenient tools to assist teams in creating high-quality documentation directly from their debug data.
- **AI-Assisted Documentation:** With the help of AI, ReAPI transforms debug data into comprehensive, well-structured documentation, making the process more efficient and effective.
- **Seamless Integration:** These tools are designed to integrate seamlessly with the debugging process, ensuring that documentation is not compromised.

### The Importance of Detail and Quality in Public API Documentation

- **Public API Challenges:** When publishing API documentation to the public, the details and quality become significantly more important. Public users won't have the opportunity to ask questions face-to-face, making clear and detailed documentation crucial.
- **Building Trust and Usability:** High-quality documentation fosters trust and usability, ensuring that external developers can effectively understand and implement your API.

With that being said, ReAPI provides convenient tools to help Code-First teams create good documentation right from their debug data with AI's help, especially crucial when preparing documentation for public release.
