# Version Management in ReAPI

## Overview

- **Simplicity in Versioning:** ReAPI makes it easy to manage multiple versions for a service, providing a straightforward approach to API versioning. This feature allows you to maintain different iterations of your APIs efficiently.

- **Initial Version State:** When a new version is created in ReAPI, its content starts as empty. This gives you the flexibility to define the version content according to your needs.

- **Manual Updates:** It's crucial to manually update the content of a new version once you are satisfied with the changes made in the live version. This ensures that the version reflects the desired state of your API.

- **Reflecting Further Changes:** If further modifications are required after the initial update, you must re-update the version to incorporate these new changes. This step ensures that the latest improvements or adjustments are captured accurately.

This process helps maintain consistency and accuracy across different API versions, allowing for controlled and deliberate updates without disrupting existing integrations.

## Live Version vs. Named Version

**Live Version:**

- **Real-time Updates:** The "live" version in ReAPI automatically updates with every edit and save you make. It's ideal for ongoing development and testing because it always reflects the latest changes.

- **Reader View:** When accessing an API, the reader view uses the live version by default, ensuring viewers see the most current state of the API.

**Named Version:**

- **Stable Releases:** Named versions are like official releases. Once created, a named version captures your API's state at that point and makes it a standalone version. This is helpful for marking stable milestones or completed features.

- **Consistency and Reliability:** Named versions are usually not changed after they’re created, which keeps them stable and reliable, especially important for production environments.

- **Public Sharing:** Only named versions can be shared publicly. This means external users or partners can access a stable, tested version of your API, minimizing the risk of sharing unfinished or unstable features.

- **Dependency Management:** If your API relies on components from other services, creating a named version resolves these dependencies by incorporating them into the version. This ensures the named version is self-contained and doesn’t depend on external services, enhancing its stability and portability.

This distinction between live and named versions helps you effectively manage the development lifecycle, supporting both iterative development and stable release management while ensuring dependencies are handled properly.

## Making Changes to a Release

We understand that there are situations where you need to make changes to a released version, such as correcting a typo or addressing a minor issue. In these cases, follow these steps to update a named version:

1. **Create a Temporary Service:**

   - Open the version edit dialog and create a temporary service. This will automatically copy the content into a new temporary service where you can make your changes.

2. **Make and Save Changes:**

   - Edit the temporary service as needed and save your changes. Ensure that all necessary updates are applied.

3. **Publish Back to Named Version:**

   - Once you are satisfied with the changes, publish the content back to the named version. This updates the named version with the corrected content.

4. **Delete the Temporary Service:**
   - Finally, delete the temporary service from the dialog. This step is important because the temporary service will use your service quota just like any normal service.

**Note:** When editing a release, remember that it is self-contained and should not add dependencies to other services. If you need to create a version that relies on other services, you should clone the service instead of editing the release directly.

These steps ensure that you can efficiently make necessary corrections to a release without disrupting your workflow or exceeding your service quota.
