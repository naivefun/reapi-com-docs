# Version Management in ReAPI

ReAPI adopts a unique approach to version management that aligns with the overarching structure of a project rather than individual services. This method is particularly effective in maintaining consistency across services, especially when they share components.

### Project-Level Versioning

- **Cross-Service Consistency**: In ReAPI, versioning is managed at the project level. This is due to the platform's support for cross-service component references, where a change in one component could impact multiple services. Ensuring that these changes are consistent across the entire project is crucial.
- **Implication for Service-Level Versioning**: If you require versioning at the service level, it is recommended to create a project dedicated to that solo service. This approach allows for more granular control over the versioning of individual services.

### Development Cycle and Version Archiving

- **New Version Initiation**: When starting a new development cycle in ReAPI, the entire content of the project is packaged and archived under the previous version number. This archival ensures that there is a stable reference point for the project's state at the end of each development cycle.
- **Ongoing Changes and Publishing**: After archiving, you can proceed to make and publish changes to the current version number throughout the development cycle. This flexibility allows for continuous integration and deployment practices.
- **New Version for New Cycle**: At the commencement of a new development cycle, a new version is introduced. This marks the beginning of a fresh phase of development and updates.

### Ensuring Consistency in Versioning

- **Comprehensive Packaging**: Even minor changes within a version result in the packaging of the entire project. This approach is adopted to ensure that all components of the project remain consistent and aligned with the version's state.
- **Project Integrity**: By packaging the whole project for each version, ReAPI ensures that the integrity and consistency of the project are maintained, regardless of the scale of changes made.

### Conclusion

Version management in ReAPI is designed to uphold the integrity and consistency of the entire project. By focusing on project-level versioning and ensuring comprehensive packaging with each version, ReAPI facilitates a robust and reliable development process. This approach aligns well with modern development practices, accommodating the complexities of projects with multiple interdependent services.
