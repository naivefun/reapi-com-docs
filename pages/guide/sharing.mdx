# Share and Export in ReAPI: Flexibility and Integration

ReAPI offers versatile options for sharing and exporting your API documentation, catering to both internal collaboration within a workspace and external integration with the broader OpenAPI ecosystem.

### Default Sharing within Workspace

- **Readability Across Workspace**: By default, APIs created in ReAPI are readable to all members within the same workspace on the platform. This feature facilitates easy collaboration and review among team members working on the same project.

### Exporting OpenAPI Specifications

- **Manual Export Process**: To leverage the full benefits of the OpenAPI specification and its ecosystem, ReAPI allows you to manually export your API documentation.
- **Resolved and Self-Contained Specs**: When you export, you select the target version of your API. The exported specification is fully resolved and self-contained, meaning all references within the API are processed and included in the export. This ensures that the exported document is comprehensive and can be used independently of the ReAPI platform.

### Creating and Using Shared Links

- **Option for External Sharing**: In addition to exporting, ReAPI provides the option to create a shared link. This link is a URL that can be accessed remotely, making it ideal for automation and integration purposes.
- **Manual Push Required**: Initially, the shared link is inactive. To activate it, you need to manually push a specific version of your API documentation to the link. This step ensures that the content shared externally is controlled and deliberate.
- **Use Cases for Shared Links**: Shared links are particularly useful for scenarios where your API documentation needs to be integrated into external systems, CI/CD pipelines, or accessed by external stakeholders who do not have access to your ReAPI workspace.

### Conclusion

The sharing and exporting features in ReAPI provide a balance between ease of collaboration within a workspace and the flexibility to integrate with external systems and stakeholders. Whether you are looking to share your API documentation internally, export it for broader use, or integrate it into automated workflows, ReAPI offers the tools to do so efficiently and effectively.
