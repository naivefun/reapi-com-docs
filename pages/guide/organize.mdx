# How ReAPI Organizes APIs

Let's walk you through how our platform organizes APIs for an efficient and streamlined experience.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Signing Up and Creating Workspaces

After signing up for ReAPI:

- **Create Workspaces**: These are your primary areas for organizing API development. Each workspace is like a comprehensive folder where you manage different API aspects.

### Step 2: Utilizing Workspaces

In each workspace, you can:

- **Create and Manage Projects**: Here is where most of your API work happens.
- **Manage Workspace Members**: Add or remove team members and control their access.
- **Manage Public APIs**: Handle APIs that are accessible publicly.
- **Configure OpenAI API Key**: Set up your OpenAI API key for AI-powered functionalities.

### Step 3: Setting Up Projects

Within each workspace:

- **Create Projects**: A project can consist of one or more microservices.
- **Organize Microservices**: Each microservice represents a set of APIs, helping you categorize and manage them effectively.



### Step 4: Managing API Types and Versioning

At the project level, ReAPI supports different types of services:

- **REST API Service**: These can be exported as self-contained OpenAPI specifications.
- **Component Repository**: Use this to store shared definitions that can be reused across different APIs.
- **Messaging Service**: For managing asynchronous messaging services like websockets or pub-sub communications.

Additionally, ReAPI ensures:

- **Unified Versioning**: Consistent versioning across all services in a project, ensuring reference consistency.
</Steps>

ReAPI's structured approach ensures your API development is well-organized, from workspace creation to managing different types of APIs and version control. This organization paves the way for a more efficient and streamlined API development process.
