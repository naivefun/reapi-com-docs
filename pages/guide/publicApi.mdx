# Public API Feature in ReAPI

ReAPI offers a distinctive feature for users who need to provide public access to their APIs. This functionality is especially useful for sharing API documentation or endpoints with external parties, such as third-party developers, partners, or publicly accessible client applications.

### Enabling Public API Access

- **Workspace Settings**: To make an API publicly accessible, you first need to enable the 'Public API' feature in your workspace settings. This setting is a prerequisite for creating public-facing APIs within ReAPI.

### Creating and Managing Public APIs

- **Public API Configuration**: Once the Public API feature is enabled, you can create a public API with its unique name, version, and description in the 'Public API' section of ReAPI.
- **Content Duplication from Internal APIs**: To populate the content of the public API, you can simply copy a version of any service from your workspace. This allows you to repurpose existing internal API documentation or configurations for public use.

### Decoupling of Public and Internal APIs

- **Independent Management**: It's important to note that public APIs are managed separately from internal APIs within ReAPI. The content of a public API does not automatically update when changes are made to its internal counterpart.
- **Manual Content Management**: You need to manually copy and update the content from your private APIs to their public versions. This approach ensures that public APIs are deliberately curated and controlled, allowing for precise management of what is shared externally.

### Use Cases for Public APIs

- **External Collaboration and Integration**: Public APIs are ideal for scenarios where you need to share API documentation or endpoints with external stakeholders without granting them access to your entire workspace.
- **Client-Facing Applications**: They can also be used to provide necessary endpoints for client-facing applications that interact with your system, ensuring controlled and secure public access.

### Conclusion

The Public API feature in ReAPI provides a controlled and efficient way to make selected APIs accessible to external parties. By enabling this feature and managing public APIs separately, ReAPI ensures that users have full control over what is shared publicly, maintaining the integrity and security of their internal APIs.
