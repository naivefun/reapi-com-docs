# Reusable Components in ReAPI: Embracing Efficiency and Consistency

ReAPI is built on the principles of "never repeat" and consistency, which is why we fully embrace the concept of reusable components in OpenAPI. Our implementation includes the most important component types, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of API documentation and development.

### Core OpenAPI Reusable Components

- **Schema**: Defines the structure and format of data. ReAPI allows you to define schemas once and reference them across your API, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
- **Parameter**: Common parameters can be defined once and reused in multiple operations, streamlining the documentation process.
- **Response**: Standard responses, such as error messages or common data structures, can be defined as reusable components.
- **Security Scheme**: Security requirements, like OAuth2 or API keys, are defined once and applied across multiple API endpoints.
- **Example**: Predefined examples for request and response bodies can be reused, providing clarity and consistency in how API endpoints function.

### ReAPI-Specific Reusable Components

- **Format**: In OpenAPI, a format is typically a string that specifies the type of data, like 'date-time' or 'email'. In ReAPI, we extend this concept to encompass more complex, business-specific formats.

  - **Example**: A team might have a specific format for product codes or identifiers that include a combination of letters and numbers, along with specific rules about their structure. In ReAPI, this custom format can be defined with a detailed description and reused across various API endpoints.

- **Schema Template**: This unique component type acts as a generic wrapper, enhancing the flexibility of schema definitions.
  - **Functionality**: A Schema Template in ReAPI allows you to define a generic structure, such as a response wrapper, with placeholders that can be dynamically replaced with specific schemas.
  - **Use Case**: For instance, you might have a standard response format that includes fields for status, message, and data. The 'data' field can be a placeholder in the Schema Template, which is then replaced with the actual response schema for different endpoints.

### The Advantage of Reusable Components in ReAPI

By leveraging reusable components, ReAPI ensures that API documentation and development are not only efficient but also consistent. This approach minimizes the need to duplicate definitions, reducing the potential for errors and discrepancies. It also streamlines the process of updating the API, as changes made to a reusable component automatically propagate to all instances where it's used.

ReAPI's extension of the reusable components concept, particularly with the introduction of custom formats and schema templates, demonstrates our commitment to providing a versatile and powerful tool for API development. These features cater to the specific needs of businesses and development teams, offering a level of customization and flexibility that aligns with the diverse requirements of modern API ecosystems.
